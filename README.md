# üìä Option Pricing Models and Their Accuracy

## üöÄ Overview

This project is part of **FinSearch**, focusing on understanding, implementing, and comparing different **Option Pricing Models**. The goal is to analyze how these models perform in pricing options and to explore their mathematical foundations, practical implementations, and accuracy using real stock data.
